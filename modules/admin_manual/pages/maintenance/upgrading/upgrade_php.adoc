:description: Upgrade PHP to versions 7.0 - 7.3 on Red Hat and CentOS so that you can make the most out of your ownCloud installations.

== Introduction

You should, almost, always upgrade to the latest version of PHP supported by ownCloud, if and where possible. 
And if you're on a version of PHP older than 5.6 you *need* to upgrade. 
This guide steps you through upgrading your installation of PHP to version 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 or 7.3 on Red Hat or CentOS 7.
